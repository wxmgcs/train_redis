----- testCacheRows -----
First, let's schedule caching of itemX every 5 seconds
Our schedule looks like:
  itemX, 1.510586472E9
We'll start a caching thread that will cache the data...
Our cached data looks like:
{"id":"itemX","data":"data to cache...","time":1510586472}

We'll check again in 5 seconds...
Notice that the data has changed...
{"id":"itemX","data":"data to cache...","time":1510586477}

The cache was cleared? true

----- testCacheRequest -----
We are going to cache a simple request against http://test.com/?item=itemX
We got initial content:
content for http://test.com/?item=itemX

To test that we've cached the request, we'll pass a bad callback
We ended up getting the same response!
content for http://test.com/?item=itemX
